VUE 3 STATUS SUMMARY:

================================================================
INSTALLATION: 

`npm i --force` lmao. Ignore the bloody complaints.


Turned off all routes to reduce scope.

Summary:
- `v-list` and subcomponents like `list-item-content` and `list-item-icon` are totally gone.
- `v-icon` don't work the same way it used to, the icons are currently patched in kinda correctly, but it's a little all over the place.
- `v-menu` and several other similar systems don't work the same way as before.
- THEMES is totally fucked, I don't really know what's wrong with it.

Good things:
- it seems the store is kinda working fine though.
- Single File Components haven't totally given out yet.
